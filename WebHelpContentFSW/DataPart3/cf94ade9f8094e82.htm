</a>Tolerance for the comparison of test sweep and reference</div></div><p>Since the LO frequency is displaced downwards in the reference sweep, the conversion loss of the mixer may differ from that of the test sweep. This is due to the fact that the LO output power of the R&amp;S<span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS; font-size: 10.5pt"> </span>FSW varies with the frequency, and also due to the non-ideal characteristics of the mixer. A certain tolerance should therefore be permitted for the comparison of the signal levels in the test sweep and reference sweep. A user-defined threshold is used to determine deviations.</p><div class="block"><div class="subtitle"><a name="ID_c31a473b8bdfd5300a710a3100cfcecd-24a48b8b71093ce10a0020190133b1b2-en-US">
</a>Auto ID detection threshold</div></div><p>Real input signals are displayed at the same frequency in the test and reference sweeps, i.e. theoretically, identical signal levels are expected at the frequency of the real mixer product in both sweeps. If the level difference is lower than the user-defined threshold, the signal obtained in the test sweep is displayed. If a signal occurs only in the test sweep or reference sweep, it is an unwanted mixer product. The level of this signal is compared to the noise floor in the other sweep. If the S/N ratio is sufficiently large, the threshold is exceeded. This means that the signal with the lower level, i.e. noise in this case, is displayed.</p><p>Note that the Auto ID method operates according to the fail-safe principle, i.e. unwanted mixer products may not be detected as such but signals which are in fact real input signals are not blanked out.</p><div class="block"><div class="subtitle"><a name="ID_ac9e5f325f9f8e180a00206a003ff42d-24a48b8b71093ce10a0020190133b1b2-en-US">
</a>Time-constant spectrum</div></div><p>The automatic comparison of the test sweep and reference sweep with the Auto ID function can only be applied usefully for signals with a time-constant spectrum since the two sweeps are always required to determine the actual spectrum.</p><div class="block"><div class="subtitle"><a name="ID_82e49aa16c8a11de8018a2d425ab5fe3-24a48b8b71093ce10a0020190133b1b2-en-US">
</a>Mixer products with low S/N ratio</div></div><p>If the S/N ratio of a mixer product is lower than the user-defined threshold, the level difference between the test sweep and reference sweep at the frequency of this mixer product is always within limits, even if the signal occurs in one of the sweeps only. Such mixer products cannot be identified by the Auto ID function. It is therefore recommended that you perform a visual comparison of the test sweep and reference sweep using the Signal ID function.</p><div class="block"><div class="subtitle"><a name="ID_024c440c6c8b11de8018a2d425ab5fe3-24a48b8b71093ce10a0020190133b1b2-en-US">
</a>Examining unwanted mixer products with small span</div></div><p>With large spans in which non-modulated sine-wave signals are represented as single lines, unwanted mixer products are generally completely blanked out. However, if you examine the frequency range containing a blanked signal in detail using a small span, e.g. an image-frequency response, part of the signal may nevertheless be displayed. This happens when the displayed components of a blanked signal have a level difference which is smaller than the user-defined threshold when compared with the noise floor. These components are therefore not blanked out.</p><p>An unwanted signal with an S/N ratio that corresponds approximately to the user-defined threshold may not be blanked out permanently. Due to the fact that the noise display varies from one sweep to another, the S/N ratio changes and thus the level difference between the test sweep and reference sweep measured at a frequency changes as well. As a result, the criterion for detecting unwanted signals is not fulfilled. To blank out unwanted signals permanently, an almost constant noise indication is therefore required. This can be achieved by reducing the video bandwidth. Since the average noise indication lies well below the generated noise peak values, the minimum level diminishes. For identification using the Auto ID function, signals should have this minimum noise level.</p><div class="block"><div class="subtitle"><a name="ID_8e7639566c8b11de8018a2d425ab5fe3-24a48b8b71093ce10a0020190133b1b2-en-US">
</a>Display of mixer products at the same frequency</div></div><p>If the input signal consists of a very large number of spectral components, it will become more and more probable that two different unwanted mixer products will be displayed at the same frequency in the test sweep and reference sweep.</p><div class="block" id="ID_c5c6486cce1042ed0a710a3100e3d204-24a48b8b71093ce10a0020190133b1b2-en-US"><div class="graphic"><img border="0" src="Resources/Images/img3d1eaf88ce0dab8a0a00206a00e208cf_1_--_--_PNG96.png" alt="" title="">

</a>Example: </span><p>The external mixer is set to use the 2nd order harmonic. The signal recorded in the test sweep is displayed by trace 1. The IF filter of the R&amp;S<span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS; font-size: 10.5pt"> </span>FSW is represented at a 3 dB bandwidth of 20 kHz, the real IF bandwidth being 30 kHz. If, however, the 3 dB bandwidth of the signal recorded in the reference sweep is examined (trace 2), it will be found to be larger exactly by a factor of 2. This shows that the two products were generated by mixing with LO harmonics of different orders. The signal recorded in the test sweep was generated by mixing with the 3rd order harmonic. Since the frequency axis scaling is based on the 2nd order, the mixer product or the resulting diagram of the IF filter is compressed by a factor of 2/3. The signal recorded in the reference sweep was generated by mixing with the fundamental of the LO signal. Since the frequency axis scaling is based on the 2nd order, the mixer product or the resulting diagram of the IF filter is expanded by a factor of 2.</p></div><p>Automatic identification with a large span is not possible since the two mixer products are displayed at the same frequency.
