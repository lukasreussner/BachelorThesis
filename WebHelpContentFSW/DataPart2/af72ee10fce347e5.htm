Depending on the task or type of signal, a different set of measurement functions and parameters are required. Therefore, the R&amp;S<span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS; font-size: 10.5pt"> </span>FSW provides various applications - some of which are included in the base unit, others are optional. The default application when you start the R&amp;S<span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS; font-size: 10.5pt"> </span>FSW is "Spectrum", for basic spectrum analysis measurements on any type of signal.</p><p>For each application, a separate measurement channel is created, which determines the measurement settings for that application. The same application can be activated with different measurement settings by creating several channels for the same application. Each channel is displayed in a separate tab on the screen.</p><div class="block"><div class="note"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td width="46" align="left" valign="top"><img src="Resources/workspace/img/info_small_10mm.gif" width="38" height="38" class="note_img">

</a>Signal and Spectrum Analyzer Mode</div></div><p>With the <b>conventional R&amp;S<span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS; font-size: 10.5pt"> </span>FSW Signal and Spectrum Analyzer</b> mode, you can perform several different measurements almost simultaneously. However, the individual measurements are independent of each other - <b>each application captures and evaluates its own set of data</b>, regardless of what the other applications do.</p><p>In some cases it may be useful to <b>analyze the exact same input data using different applications</b>. For example, imagine capturing data from a base station and analyzing the RF spectrum in the Analog Demodulation application. If a spur or an unexpected peak occurs, you may want to analyze the same data in the I/Q Analyzer to see the real and imaginary components of the signal and thus detect the reason for the irregular signal. Normally when you switch to a different application, evaluation is performed on the data that was captured by that application, and not the previous one. In our example that would mean the irregular signal would be lost. Therefore, a second operating mode is available in the R&amp;S<span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS; font-size: 10.5pt"> </span>FSW: Multi-Standard Radio Analyzer (MSRA) mode.</p><div class="block"><div class="subtitle"><a name="ID_182ec7cfc10dd15d0a001ae7668bb086-ad1caf018061c12d0a00206a014afc56-en-US">
</a>Multi-Standard Radio Analyzer mode</div></div><p>In <b>Multi-Standard Radio Analyzer (MSRA) mode</b>, data acquisition is performed once as an I/Q measurement in a master application, and the captured data is then evaluated by any number of slave applications for different radio standards. Data acquisition and global configuration settings are controlled globally, while the evaluation and display settings can be configured individually for each slave application. Using the Multi-Standard Radio Analyzer, unwanted correlations between different signal components using different transmission standards can be detected. Thus, for example, an irregularity in a GSM burst can be examined closer in the R&amp;S<span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS; font-size: 10.5pt"> </span>FSW 3G FDD BTS (W-CDMA) slave application to reveal dependencies like a change in the EVM value.</p><div class="block"><div class="subtitle"><a name="ID_22433052c03b3e810a710ade0157ecc0-ad1caf018061c12d0a00206a014afc56-en-US">
</a>Multi-Standard Real-Time mode</div></div><p>In order to combine the advantages of the MSRA mode with its correlated measurements and the gapless results and frequency mask provided by real-time measurements, a third operating mode has been introduced: the <b>Multi-Standard Real-Time (MSRT) mode</b>. This operating mode is only available if one of the real-time options (R&amp;S<span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS; font-size: 10.5pt"> </span>FSW-K160RE/-B160R/-B512R/-U160R/-U512R) is installed.</p><p>In this operating mode, data acquisition is performed once as a real-time measurement, and the captured data is then evaluated by any number of slave applications. Thus, a real-time measurement triggered with a frequency mask can be performed, and the results can be evaluated in the VSA slave application, for example, to detect the cause of a frequency exception.</p><div class="block"><div class="subtitle"><a name="ID_ced5050039679c810a00206a000347fe-ad1caf018061c12d0a00206a014afc56-en-US">
</a>Distinct operating modes</div></div><a name="kanchor336">
</a><p>Although the applications themselves are identical in all operating modes, the handling of the data between applications is not. Thus, the operating mode determines which slave applications are available and active. Whenever you change the operating mode, the currently active measurement channels are closed. The default operating mode is Signal and Spectrum Analyzer mode; however, the presetting can be changed.</p><div class="block"><div class="subtitle"><a name="ID_cddd21ef5cf776ea0a00206a00b9ddec-ad1caf018061c12d0a00206a014afc56-en-US">
