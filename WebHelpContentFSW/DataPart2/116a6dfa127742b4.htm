</a><div class="chm-chaptertitle">Basics on Transducer Factors</div><p>The transducer allows you to manipulate the trace at discrete trace points to correct the signal coming from an input device. Transducers are often used to correct the frequency response for antennas, for example. The transducer is configured by defining transducer factors for specific trace points. A set of transducer factors defines an interpolated transducer line and can be stored on the instrument.</p><p>In the Spectrum application, the correction factor from all active transducers is calculated for each displayed trace point once in advance and is added to the result of the level measurement during the sweep. If the sweep range changes, the correction values are calculated again. If several measured values are combined in one point, only one value is taken into consideration. If the active transducer line is not defined for the entire sweep range, the missing values are replaced by zeroes.</p><p>When a transducer is used, the trace is shifted by a calculated factor. However, an upward shift reduces the dynamic range for the displayed values. Thus, the reference level can be adapted automatically to restore the original dynamic range. The reference level is shifted by the maximum transducer factor. By default, if transducers are active the reference level function is adapted automatically to obtain the best dynamic performance.</p><p>If a transducer factor is active, "TDF" is displayed in the channel bar.</p><div class="block"><div class="note"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td width="46" align="left" valign="top"><img src="Resources/workspace/img/info_small_10mm.gif" width="38" height="38" class="note_img">
