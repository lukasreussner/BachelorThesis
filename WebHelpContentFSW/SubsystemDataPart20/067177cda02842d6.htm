</a><div class="chm-chaptertitle">Characteristics of the IEEE 802.11ad Standard</div><p>The popular wireless transmission standard WLAN [(IEEE 802.11)] has been amended and updated regularly since it was first published in order to accommodate for constant demands of transmitting higher data rates and larger bandwidths. Multimedia data streams, for example, require very high throughput over large periods of time.</p><p>To meet this need, the Wireless Gigabit Alliance (WiGig) has developed a specification for wireless transmission of data in the 60<span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS; font-size: 10.5pt"> </span>GHz band at speeds in the multi-Gigabit range.</p><p>Thus, the 11ad physical layer was added as an amendment to the existing WLAN standard, in chapter 21 of the 802.11-2012 standard <a class="xref" href="4b8810e23c9e4f15.htm#ID_d55e26f4b599854b0a001ae732a5f90e-ab76cbbd9103646f0a001ae77b36422f-en-US">[1]</a>. It is called "<b>Directional Multi-Gigabit (DMG) PHY</b>" (or short: <em>PHY</em>).</p><div class="block"><div class="subtitle"><a name="ID_f59cacc8da0a4a980a001ae7594607a6-c1757e9e90f6a82e0a001ae7347f9a37-en-US">
</a>Used bandwidths</div></div><p>The outstanding new feature of the IEEE 802.11ad standard is the use of the 60<span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS; font-size: 10.5pt"> </span>GHz band; however, in order to maintain compatibility with existing WLAN devices, the 2.4<span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS; font-size: 10.5pt"> </span>GHz and 5<span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS; font-size: 10.5pt"> </span>GHz ranges defined by the IEEE 802.11a, b, g, and n standards are also supported.</p><p>In the range around 60<span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS; font-size: 10.5pt"> </span>GHz, an unlicensed frequency band is available everywhere in the world. This range permits higher channel bandwidths for greater throughput. Another advantage is the small wavelengths (approx. 5<span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS; font-size: 10.5pt"> </span>mm). These make it possible to use compact and competitive antennas or antenna arrays (e.g. for beamforming).</p><p>On the down side, this band has a very high free field attenuation and oxygen (O2) absorption. However, because the transmission typically takes place within a limited range of under 10 m (the typical living room), the high degree of attenuation can also be seen as an advantage. Interference from adjacent transmissions is very unlikely. The transmission is very difficult to intercept, making it even more secure. Finally, beamforming can be used to focus the power to the receiver.</p><p>Even when the IEEE 802.11ad transmission takes place in the open ISM band, interference of other applications must be minimized. Thus, a spectrum mask is defined by the standard, which must be adhered to during transmission. Therefore, an SEM measurement is provided by the R&amp;S FSW 802.11ad application.</p><div class="block"><div class="subtitle"><a name="ID_08dc7fc1b59984ce0a001ae779091aef-c1757e9e90f6a82e0a001ae7347f9a37-en-US">

</a>Package structure</div></div><p>The general structure of a package in the IEEE 802.11ad physical layer consists of the following common parts:</p><div class="block" id="ID_7fb8abe4b59984ce0a001ae75ed2f7df-c1757e9e90f6a82e0a001ae7347f9a37-en-US"><div class="graphic"><img border="0" src="Resources/Images/img57b8ba63b58069be0a001ae73a72c507_1_--_--_PNG96.png" alt="" title=""/></div><div class="caption_figure">General package structure in IEEE 802.11ad</div></div><div class="block"><ul class="list"><li value="1"><b>Preamble</b><br/>The preamble consists of the <b>short training field</b> (STF) and the <b>channel estimation</b> (CE) field. It is required in every package. It supports the receiver during automatic gain control (AGC), when recognizing the package and in estimating the frequency offset, and it displays the type of displays the type of PHY that is used (SC or OFDM). The receiver can also use the known CE field to estimate the channel.</li><li value="2"><b>Header</b><br/>The header is different for every PHY and contains additional important information for the receiver, such as the modulation mode (MCS), the length of the data field or a checksum.</li><li value="3"><b>Data</b><br/>This part is used to transmit the actual data with different modulations (MCS).

</a>Golay sequences</div></div><p>In radiocommunications, training sequences are used for channel estimation. Predefined sequences that are already known to the receiver are transmitted over the channel and evaluated by the receiver in order to estimate the channel. Complementary Golay sequences are perfectly suited to this task.</p><p>The individual fields in the IEEE 802.11ad signal packages (e.g. the preamble) are made up of Golay sequences. Each sequence consists of bipolar symbols (±1). They are constructed mathematically in order to achieve specific autocorrelation characteristics. Each consists of a complementary pair (a and b). An additional index contains the length of the sequence. For example, G<sub>a</sub>128 and G<sub>b</sub>128 represent a complementary sequence with a length of 128. In addition, four specific G<sub>x</sub>128 are then logically combined into G<sub>u</sub>512 or G<sub>v</sub>512.</p><p>The single carrier physical layers (SC, low power SC and control) nominally use a bandwidth of 1760 MHz, while the OFDM physical layer uses 1830.47 MHz.</p><div class="block"><div class="subtitle"><a name="ID_b6e58d45b59984ce0a001ae76ae10d4f-c1757e9e90f6a82e0a001ae7347f9a37-en-US">
</a>Beamforming</div></div><p>Transmission in the 60 GHz range is subject to greater free-space loss than in the 2.4 or 5<span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS; font-size: 10.5pt"> </span>GHz range. The channel conditions can change dramatically during a connection (for example, someone moves between a BluRay player and a projector during a 3DHD connection). Both can be managed in real-time by using beamforming. Because the antenna size in the 60<span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS; font-size: 10.5pt"> </span>GHz band is very compact, small and competitive antenna arrays can be used. IEEE 802.11ad supports beamforming in real-time. During the beam refinement process, training sequences for beamforming are sent between the transmitter and receiver and evaluated. The best antenna weightings for each situation can then be set.</p><p>Beamforming training sequences can be appended to all PHY packages (control, SC, low-power SC and OFDM) for this purpose. The package type and training length are set accordingly in the corresponding header.</p><div class="block"><div class="subtitle"><a name="ID_040d66864c8011e5bc5ac67b2f458b30-c1757e9e90f6a82e0a001ae7347f9a37-en-US">
