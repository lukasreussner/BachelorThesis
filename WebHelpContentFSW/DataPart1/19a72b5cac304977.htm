</a><div class="chm-chaptertitle">Initial Measurement - Peak Search</div><p>The purpose of an initial peak search is to find signals with a high interference level quickly. Usually the peak search is performed with a fast detector like the peak or average detector. The initial peak search is the basis for a possible refined measurement of interferences with the detectors specific to EMI measurements.</p><p>The results of the initial peak search are shown in the Marker Table (see <a class="xref" href="05c54c4711af4ec3.htm#ID_23283a058fca1f5d0a00206a0027fea8-e2264ba9ad4233020a00201901671d4f-en-US">"EMI Measurement Results"</a>).</p><p>Peak searches can be performed automatically or manually.</p><div class="block"><div class="subtitle"><a name="ID_aef9334581a1710b0a710a9200c6948c-e2264ba9ad4233020a00201901671d4f-en-US">
</a>Automatic peak search</div></div><p>If enabled, the automatic peak search starts as soon as you select the EMI measurement and one or more markers are active. During automatic peak search, the R&amp;S<span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS; font-size: 10.5pt"> </span>FSW looks for the strongest peaks in the frequency range you are measuring and positions a marker on those peaks after each sweep. If a <b>limit line</b> is assigned to the trace, the peak search is based on the level difference between the trace and the limit line. For each active marker a peak is searched. You can use up to 16 markers simultaneously.</p><p>The largest peak is always assigned to the active marker with the lowest number; subsequent peaks are assigned to the active markers in ascending order.</p><p>The R&amp;S<span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS; font-size: 10.5pt"> </span>FSW allows you to distribute markers among several traces. If you do so, the marker with the lowest number assigned to a particular trace is positioned on the largest peak of the corresponding trace.</p><div class="block"><div class="subtitle"><a name="ID_cbe6d73081b4641c0a00206a00b923b2-e2264ba9ad4233020a00201901671d4f-en-US">
</a>Manual peak search</div></div><p>If automatic peak search is off, you can set the markers to any frequency you need more information about manually. You can change the marker position with the rotary knob or the cursor keys, or position it to a particular frequency with the number keys.</p><p>Setting markers is the same as setting markers in other Spectrum measurements.

</a>Searching for peaks over several traces</div></div><p>You can search for peaks on six traces simultaneously with a different weighting detector for each trace.</p><p>In this case, the R&amp;S<span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS; font-size: 10.5pt"> </span>FSW searches for peaks on all traces separately, provided that you have assigned at least one marker to each trace.</p><p>A typical selection for EMI measurement is to use the peak and the average detector. After initial measurement, search for peaks on the peak trace and the average trace separately so that the distribution of narrowband and wideband sources of interference can be taken into account.</p><div class="block"><span class="bold"><a name="ID_d000b105ae360d660a710a3100af0a02-e2264ba9ad4233020a00201901671d4f-en-US">
