</a>Codewords, logical subcarriers, frames, and NCPs</div></div><p>The useful data that is to be transmitted to the same group of cable modems is summarized into blocks.

Such an encoded data block, which may vary in size, is referred to as a <em>codeword</em>.</p><p>The subcarriers for a single symbol in an OFDM channel that are available for useful data, that is to transmit the codewords, are called <em>logical subcarriers</em>. Logical subcarriers are combined in a <em>frame</em>.</p><p>The codewords are assigned to the next available symbol in the order they are sent. If more subcarriers are required than are still empty, subcarriers in the next symbol are assigned to the block as well. Up to four consecutive symbols can be used by any one codeword. Therefore it is necessary to document the assignment of codewords to symbols.</p><p>For each new codeword that starts in a symbol, the first subcarrier of the codeword is provided as a <em>Next Codeword Pointer (NCP)</em>. The NCPs are also included in the frame. NCPs are modulated using QPSK, 16-QAM or 64-QAM. Which modulation is used for the NCP is indicated by the PLC.</p><p>Finally, for error protection, each frame contains a <em>Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)</em> block, based on all NCPs in the frame.</p><div class="block" id="ID_31a463b9a56e11e48e278603e207e09d-9b259ec462896a0f0a001ae700ae4a16-en-US"><div class="graphic"><img border="0" src="Resources/Images/img28a54adb2610a5430a001ae74ee494f9_1_--_--_PNG96.png" alt="" title="">

For each codeword, an entry in the table is required, which assigns the (first and) total number of subcarriers per codeword, or alternatively the first and total number of OFDM symbols. Furthermore, the profile (that is: modulation) to be used for the codeword is defined. Note that since one OFDM symbol may contain more than one codeword, and each codeword may use a different modulation, the same OFDM symbol may have a "mixed modulation".</p><div class="block"><div class="subtitle"><a name="ID_3a358d2f26dc32790a001ae701542cd8-9b259ec462896a0f0a001ae700ae4a16-en-US">

In this case, multiple measurements are performed, if necessary, to obtain the required number of frames. Using a defined number of frames to base statistics on makes the results more consistent, as the number of frames detected in each measurement (and which are thus available in the capture buffer) may vary. If evaluation is restricted to a single frame, no statistics are calculated for the summarized results.</p><p>Note that frames from multiple measurements can be included in statistical evaluation; however, only frames in the current capture buffer can be analyzed and displayed individually.</p><p>&#160;</p><hr width="100%" size="0" align="center" /><table style="border-style: none;"><col style="width: 50%;" /><col style="width: 50%;" /><tbody><tr><td style="color: #808080; font-size: 8pt; border-style: none; padding: 4pt"><a href="https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/imprint" style="color: #808080;text-decoration: underline;">Imprint</a> | <a href="https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/statement-of-privacy" style="color: #808080;text-decoration: underline;">Statement of Privacy</a> | <a href="https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/terms-and-conditions" style="color: #808080;text-decoration: underline;">Terms &amp; Conditions</a></td><td style="text-align: right;color: #808080;font-size: 8pt; border-style: none; padding: 4pt">&#169; 2018 ROHDE &amp; SCHWARZ</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p></div><script type="text/javascript" src="SkinSupport/MadCapBodyEnd.js">/* <![CDATA[ */
