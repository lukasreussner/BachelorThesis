</a><div class="chm-chaptertitle">Typical Applications</div><p>Digital modulated signals are similar to white noise within the transmit channel, but are different in their amplitude distribution. In order to transmit the modulated signal without distortion, all amplitudes of the signal have to be transmitted linearly from the output power amplifier. Most critical are the peak amplitude values. Degradation in transmit quality caused by a transmitter two port network is dependent on the amplitude of the peak values as well as on their probability.</p><p>If modulation types are used that do not have a constant envelope in zero span, the transmitter has to handle peak amplitudes that are greater than the average power. This includes all modulation types that involve amplitude modulation, QPSK for example. CDMA transmission modes in particular may have power peaks that are large compared to the average power.</p><p>For signals of this kind, the transmitter must provide large reserves for the peak power to prevent signal compression and thus an increase of the bit error rate at the receiver. The peak power or the crest factor of a signal is therefore an important transmitter design criterion. The crest factor is defined as the peak power to mean power ratio or, logarithmically, as the peak level minus the average level of the signal. To reduce power consumption and cut costs, transmitters are not designed for the largest power that could ever occur, but for a power that has a specified probability of being exceeded (e.g. 0.01<span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS; font-size: 10.5pt"> </span>%).</p><p>The statistical functions provide information on such signal criteria.</p><div class="chm-go-to-top"><span><a class="chm-go-to-top" href="#top">Top</a></span></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="SkinSupport/MadCapBodyEnd.js">/* <![CDATA[ */
